<h1>N-Puzzle Game Solver using A* Algorithm in C#</h1>
<h2>The project of AI course</h2>
<h4>This project is an implementation of the classic N-Puzzle game solved using the A* search algorithm.
  The N-Puzzle is a sliding puzzle that consists of a grid of tiles (e.g., 3x3, 4x4) with one tile missing.
<h4>The A* algorithm is used to find the shortest sequence of moves to solve the puzzle.
It employs a heuristic function (Manhattan Distance) to efficiently explore the state space and find the optimal solution.
